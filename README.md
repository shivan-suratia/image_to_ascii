# imagetoascii
# This project works with web scraping and image libraries to convert any user input into ascii art.  # The user input is taken, put into a google search query, and then the webpage is scraped to find the first image result.  # This image is then converted into ascii. The image is resized and converted into grayscale. # Next, each pixel in the picture is converted to a pixel in a character array. This array is then printed to display the ascii art.
